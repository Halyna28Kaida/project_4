# SQL project
## ___Halyna Kaida___

In this project we have two files with creating tables:

1. t_{jmeno}_{prijmeni}_project_SQL_primary_final
2. t_{jmeno}_{prijmeni}_project_SQL_secondary_final


 and five files with queries.

 1. _query_1._ **Are wages increasing in all industry sectors over the years, or are they decreasing in some?**
 In this output we see, that wages in some sectors over the years are decreasing. But here we do not have accurate output, because there are missing some values about sectors.

 2. _query_2._ **How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be purchased for the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?** Here we can see, that we can buy 1308 kg of a bread or 1460 liters of milk in the year 2006 and 1363 kg of a bread or 1667 liters of milk in the year 2018.

 3. _query_3._ **Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?**. In this result we can observe that some products are not even increasing but decreasing. 

 4. _query_4._ **Is there a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?**. Answer: there is not.
 
 5. _query_5_. **Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or following year by a more significant increase?** As we can see, the level of GDP does not affect changes in wages and prices either the current or following year.
